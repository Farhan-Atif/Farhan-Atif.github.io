	  <h4 align=center> This Thing They Call Death </h4>
	  <p align=center> It follows you everywhere<br>
	  It's fixed after your first breath<br>
	  Nowhere is safe for it is there<br>
	  This thing that they call death</p>
	  <p align=center> It goes from door to door<br>
	  As if it's selling meth<br>
	  It'll lure you out to kill some more<br>
	  This thing they call death</p>
	  <p align=center> It takes away your loved<br>
	  It can't be stopped by one or all<br>
	  It'll creep into your bath<br>
	  And kill you before you fall</p>
	  <p align=center> The biggest lie that ever existed <br>
	  That couples say all the time<br>
	  We'll love each other till <br>
	  We are seperated by this thing they call death</p>
	  <p align=center> It will and has always come for you <br>
	  You can't hide your body nor your breath <br>
	  You will fall in a deep sleep <br>
	  Thanks to this thing they call death</p>
